# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge - Georgia Institute of Technology Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp

Imported United States Geological Survey (USGS) earquake data to visualize.
Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
Defined markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size, and the depth of the earthquake by color. 
Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
Created a legend that provides context for the map data.
